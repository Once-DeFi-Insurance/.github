#  Once Defi Insurance 



## ONCE is a Dapp using the decentralized protocol that allows for crypto Life assurance 
Paying assurance premiums monthly result in annual increases and often leads to abandoned assurance policies with the insured very often not completing the term of assurance, thereby losing the benefit of time.

Value Propositiion: A decentralized risk management system That creates tokenized value from peoples’ lives

The Once Token is a real person’s life representation in the digital world in a NFT format. In this sense a person can generate a token that represents their life and place it in a marketplace. At the same time a crypto life assurance monetizes the moment of death in case that person dies. The holder of the NFT is the one that receives the value of the crypto life assurance. Consequently, this can only be achieved if the requirements in the smart contract are met.

This model allows users to set up a price tag for their lives, by having an asset that materializes when the user dies. i.e. should they stake 1 ETH and be assured for 5 ETH, the marketplace could offer 1.5 ETH and the beneficiary would then be the owner of the NFT.
