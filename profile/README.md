## ONCE is a Dapp using the decentralized protocol that allows for crypto Life assurance 
Paying assurance premiums monthly result in annual increases and lead to abandoned assurance policies with the insured very often not completing the term of assurance, thereby losing the benefit of time.
Value proposition, current legal framework of normal insurance industry, 
Who are our clients and what the people look like
(Alberto salesforce)
Outside current legal framework - 
The limitation of assurance on Blockchain is the “source of truth”, opening the option of ONCE payment to fraud. 
By incorporating the principle of “trust through consensus”, the ONCE protocol creates a way for insured to show trustworthiness based on the collective assessment of other participants rather than based on face value.
The protocol can then use this collective assessment as a signal for automatically allocating insurance with a ONCE payment of 5 years or 10 years, with a payout and a premium determined by the assessor. 

The random assessor will determine the risk and signal the contract release, for this they would get an upfront 10% of the fee paid.  All information will be stored on chain and accessible by the Insurer

The Insurer will have an Insurance Pool, where they make a sum for payout available, in the event of death, this is the pool that will be used to pay out the Insured.
The Pool would payout in the event of death.
The Insurer will receive 20% of the insured ONCE payment at the end of the contract.
By removing the need for medical and providing a means for   passive yield, the protocol dramatically expands both the potential insured, who can access Life Insurance at a highly reduced rate, and the potential assurance providers who can gain exposure and join the blockchain as well as earn passive income.
